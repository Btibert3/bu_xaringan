## Installing `r icon::fa("download",pull = "right")`

The **xaringan** package is on CRAN, but I recommend installing the development release from `r icon::fa("github")`

```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github('yihui/xaringan')
```

.pull-left[
You will also need two other CSS files for the custom University of Sydney styling:

- `sydney-fonts.css`
- `sydney.css`
]
.pull-right[
If you want the University Logo to show up on the title slide, you'll also need

- `USydLogo-black.svg`
]

These are available in the assets folder of the GitHub code repository [`r icon::fa("github")` `garthtarr/sydney_xaringan`](http://github.com/garthtarr/sydney_xaringan/assets)

To make things easy to get started, I recommend downloading a copy of the `sydney_xaringan` repo [`r icon::fa("file-archive")`](https://github.com/garthtarr/sydney_xaringan/archive/master.zip) and make changes to the template.

## About

Pulling select slides from 

- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/garthtarr/sydney_xaringan/master/index.Rmd

Can walk along with the slide templates (see slide, look at code) below

## Why xaringan/remark.js? `r icon::fa("check-circle", pull = "right")`

- Printing (in Google Chrome) is a lot more reliable for xaringan/remark.js
- The customisation of the CSS and using it is a lot easier in xaringan/remark.js
- You almost never need to write any manual HTML chunks (e.g. `<div style="text-align: center;"></div>`)
- With remark.js' Markdown, you can add arbitrary CSS classes to elements using syntax `.className[elements]`, which is very handy compared to `<span class="className"></span>`
- You can write slide notes under three question marks `???`. These notes are only displayed in the presentation mode, and only the speaker can see these notes. 
- The keyboard shortcuts: press keys like `P` (presentation mode), `C` (clone slides to a new window, useful for presentation mode), `B` (black out), `M` (mirror the slide), and `H` (help), etc.

## Content boxes `r icon::fa("box", pull = "right")`

.content-box-teal[This is a `.content-box-teal[]` chunk.

]

--

If you have just a few words, it only highlights the words:


.content-box-red[`.content-box-red[]`] .content-box-darkred[`.content-box-darkred[]`]

.content-box-teal[`.content-box-teal[]`] .content-box-purple[`.content-box-purple[]`]

--


> More colors = look at css for `content-box-<color>`

If the text includes a new line character, you get a 100% width box.  I've used `.columns-2[]` it's 100% of the column width.

.columns-2[
.content-box-gray[
`.content-box-gray[]`
]
.content-box-yellow[
`.content-box-yellow[]`
]
]


---


## Quotes `r icon::fa("quote-right", pull = "right")`

.small[
We can include **block quotes** using<br>
`<blockquote>Quote goes here</blockquote>` 

or<br>
`> Quote goes here`

or `.blockquote[Quote here]`
]
.pull-left[

<blockquote>
Statistics is the grammar of science. 
.right[-- <cite>Karl Pearson</cite>]
</blockquote>

.blockquote[Quote]

> Quote quote  
]



.pull-right[.small[
```
<blockquote>
Statistics is the grammar of science. 
.right[-- <cite>Karl Pearson</cite>]
</blockquote>



.blockquote[Quote]



> Quote quote
```

]]

---

## Statistical thinking

Many of the data science slides have a quote-like box for **statistical thinking** or **aim**.
.pull-left[
.small[
```
.blockquote[
### `r knitr::inline_expr('icon::fa("comment-dots")')` Statistical 
thinking
- Point 1
]
```
]
.blockquote[
### `r icon::fa("comment-dots")` Statistical thinking
- Point 1
]

]
.pull-right[

.small[
```
.blockquote[
### `r knitr::inline_expr('icon::fa("location-arrow")')` Aim
- Point 1
]
```
]
.blockquote[
### `r icon::fa("location-arrow")` Aim
- Point 1
]

]

.footnote[
This code is a bit easier to write than the old way of doing it.
```
<div class="thinkingbox"> 
### <span class="fa-stack fa"><i class="fa fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i><i class="fa fa-location-arrow fa-stack-1x fa-inverse"></i></span> Aim
- Point 1
</div>
```
]

## Scrolling R output

.scroll-output[
I tend to think it's best to format the slide such that everything you want to show is visible, however there can be times when the R output is extensive, and it's not important that the whole lot is printable (i.e. won't appear on the pdf version of the slides), but you might want to be able to scroll down interactively during the presentation.  This can be done using the `.scroll-output[]` class.

```{r}
step(lm(Fertility~.,data = swiss))
```
]

---

## Scrolling R output

If you just want a section of the output to be scrollable (not the whole page).  You need to define how many lines you want the "box" to show.  There are classes for `.scroll-box-8[]` for 8 lines, `.scroll-box-10[]` for 10 lines, ... , `.scroll-box-20[]` for 20 lines.

.pull-left[
`.scroll-box-8[]` 
.scroll-box-8[
```{r}
swiss[,1:3]
```
]]
.pull-right[
`.scroll-box-14[]` 
.scroll-box-14[
```{r}
swiss[,1:3]
```
]]

## Lists, increments and footnotes`r icon::fa("list", pull = "right")`

.pull-left[

- Unordered lists<sup>1</sup>
  - can be created using "-"
  - and they can be nested using 2 or 4 space.fn[2]
      - deep nested 
  - original nesting level


### Ordered list

1. one
2. two 
3. three



]

.footnote[
[1] Footnotes are not automatic.  In the text use `<sup>1</sup>` or `.fn[1]`

[2] At the end of the slide `.footnote[[1] Text associated with footnote 1.]`
]



--

.pull-right[
To get an incremental slide use two dashes `--` on a new line with no trailing white space. If the dashes aren't on their own line or there's a white space after it won't work.

.font80[.content-box-red[
The two dash increments don't work inside class calls.  For example, you can't have an increment in a  `.pull-right[...]` block or in a `.columns-2[...]` block as the dashes are not considered to be special in the markdown processing when they're inside one of these blocks.

## Icons `r icon::fa("exclamation", pull = "right")`

Perhaps the easiest way to include icons in your xaringan presentations is through the **icon** package. The **icon** package lets you include [font awesome](http://fontawesome.io), [academicons](http://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/) and [ionicons](http://ionicons.com) into R Markdown documents.

It's not yet on CRAN, so install it using 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("ropenscilabs/icon")
```

--

.pull-left[

```{r}
icon::fa("rocket")
icon::fa("spinner", size = 2, 
         animate = "spin")
```

]

--

.pull-right[

Inline expressions also work. 

`r icon::fa("bell")` created using 

`` `r knitr::inline_expr('icon::fa("bell")')` ``

For more info see [the `r icon::fa("github")` repo](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/icon).

## FAQ `r icon::fa("question-circle", pull = "right")`

<blockquote>
How do I start a new slide? 
</blockquote>

Using three dashes at the start of a new line <code>---</code>

--

<blockquote>
I have three dashes but it's not starting a new slide.  
</blockquote>

The three dashes need to be on their own line with **no spaces after them**

--

<blockquote>
I'm giving my presentation but the text is too small. HELP!
</blockquote>

By default remark.js disables browser based zooming. I've found and modified a hack to re-enable it, but it's not perfect. [`remark-zoom.js`](https://github.com/William-Yeh/remark-zoom) I'm also open to increasing the default font size - need to test it out on a range of displays.

## Background images

.pull-left[

- We can place images anywhere on the screen by using `background-image` in conjunction with <br>`background-position`
- The image, size and position are defined immediately after the `---` that starts a new slide.


Assuming `image.jpg` is in the same folder as your `.Rmd` file, the code is:
